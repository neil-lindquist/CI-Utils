Usage: run-fiveam [options] <test names>...
Loads the system with quicklisp then calls fiveam:run! with a list of test
names.  Each test name is parsed with read-from-string after systems are loaded,
allowing package qualified test names to be used.

If the COVERALLS environemenal variable is present and non-empty, coverage will
be measured and reported to COVERALLS on platforms supported by CI-Utils.
Additionally, the environmental variable COVERAGE_EXCLUDE is read as a colon
seperated list of paths to exclude from measuring coverage, in addition to those
specified as arguments.

Note that currently the systems in the project root are loaded with
COVERALLS is  enable.  This behavior is not to be relied on and may change in
the future, so instead use the `--quicklisp`/`-l` flag.
Options
--help|-h                     - prints this help message
--quickload|-l <sytem>        - lists an additional system to load
--coverage-exclude|-e <file>  - lists a path to excluded from the coverage
